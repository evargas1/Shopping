                <p>We started in a small town in New York and we wnated to go oversees. We come from a small company in Bulguria and than travled to America to sell the clothes that we dream of and the fact that we are about to start making clothing for men. Our vision will continue to move foward and we will not tsop now. One of us is a designer one of us has a marketing degree and the other one has a engineering degree. The companys that have started to support us made this possible. And we are forever gratfeul for all the support. This has been a great experince. This was a great time for us in college and we would not trade it for anything else. This has been the best year of our life and we really appreciate everything that our customers have done to support us. We thank Chicago the city that we grew up in and everything that has happen to us throughout this years. This was this best year of our life and it was a great time. We never knew such a time and experice would be possible untill we came to this large city from a small town essentially in the middle of nowhere and made our dreams come true we are quite thankful for verything that has happened up to this point and will continue riding this wave until it comes to an end. Such a life changing dream was really only possible thanks to all our amazing mangers that supported us wholheartdly in these insane up and down of life. We thank all of you who helped us to get to this point from all the familes that have put into it. We also went to recongize the fact that this lifestyle is not one that is seen as common amoung all of the people that we meet but its the best life we could have ever dreamed of and we will continue to remain steadfast in this career choice.</p>
